# CNN-Brain-Tumor-Detection
Created a Convolutional Neural Network which takes in Brain MRI Scans and outputs whethor or not the scans contain a tumor. 
The network achieved 97.2% accuracy. 

This project was completed by Sydney Levy and Brooke Coneeny as part of an Artificial Intelligence course at Swarthmore College.
